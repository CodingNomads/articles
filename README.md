# CodingNomads Publishing

This repo contains source materials and information for CodingNomads' educational articles.

## CodingNomads Article Drafts

We use the `/article-drafts` repo to upload article and blog post drafts for review.

Once the article has been approved, the final version will be copied to a new public repository called `articles`.

### Drafts Structure

Each article and any associated code snippets or Notebooks live in their own top-level folder

### Feedback

Feedback on writing and didactics will be preferably given in GitHub comments. Check out the [Technical Writing Materials](https://codingnomads.github.io/creator-docs/01-content-guidelines/#structure) as a guideline.
