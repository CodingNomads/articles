# Code Is Just Text

In the previous two posts you've learned how to write your code in a plain text editor, save it as a Python file, and run it to play the game. You can fetch the code [from this online resource](https://gist.github.com/martin-martin/d2f0bf7a6187a4e05d847b06e2bcee1d). In this lesson you will recap what you saw and learn more about the structure of a Python program.

## Parts of a Program

There are a lot of different concepts that went into creating even such a small program like this game you wrote. Let's take a look what they are:

In the screenshot above you can see the **filename** of the Python file you created, as well as the **code** saved you saved in the file. Now let's dive deeper into the code and learn about which **programming concepts** you touched upon by making this file.

**Fair warning**: There's a lot going on! Much like a paragraph of English, a script can be broken into many parts: an introductory sentence, references to outside text, subjects, nouns, verbs, and sometimes even new vocabulary.

Keep in mind that, like a paragraph of English, if you understand these parts, then it's likely that you can write and understand another similar paragraph. Even if you haven't seen it before. It also takes some training before you will be able to do that, so don't feel overwhelmed if you won't grasp it all right away. If you do, then wow! If you don't, that's perfectly normal. But check out the pretty colors! :)

That are a lot of colors! But don't worry if it feels like a lot right now. If you join one of our courses, you will learn to understand all of those programming concepts, and many more! Give it time and effort and you will see that you will be able to grasp it and start speaking the coding language.

Here are the important take-aways of these lessons:

- **Text**: Programming is just writing text
- **Python**: You run Python programs with `python`
- **Fun**: There's fun stuff you can build! :)
