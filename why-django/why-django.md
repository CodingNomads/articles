# Why Learn Django?

While there are many programming languages and even more web frameworks that can help you to achieve your goal of developing for the web, this video presents you a couple of reasons why **Django** is a great choice:

So why would you want to use **Django** from all the web frameworks that exist out there?

I think that one of the main reasons really is that Django is a **Python** web framework, and Python is a great language to write because it's so easily understandable and so widely used.

Maybe you already know some Python from doing data science, or maybe you've just started your programming journey with Python because it's a great language to get started. But it's also a great language to keep developing.

And Django is one of those examples. You can build very, very stable web apps using Django. Let's look at a couple of points in more detail.

So why Django, one reason is that there is a great community around Django. Lots and lots of people use the framework for lots and lots of different websites and there's community support, great docs, there's answers to questions.

One of the reasons being also that it's been around for a very long time. Django was first released in 2005. So it's time and battle-tested. There are lots and lots of people who have developed with it and who have been using it in production web apps for a long time.

So that's two good reasons for using the framework. Also, another reason is that it comes with batteries included. So what does batteries included mean? It essentially means that everything that you need already comes with the framework, and I believe the metaphor comes from if you buy some battery-powered toy that you can just start playing without having to go and get some batteries. So that's the idea behind it. 

And on the opposite spectrum of web frameworks, you would find something that's called MicroFrameworks with **Flask** being the most prominent one in the Python ecosystem. And those frameworks, they don't really have all of the bells and whistles that Django does, but instead you can think of them like a Lego base plate, on top of which you can put different pieces and assemble your web framework in that way.

Some people like this batteries-included approach some prefer the MicroFramework approach. It's a matter of taste, but I personally think that it's a good way to get started with batteries included because there's already so much going on when developing for the web, as I mentioned in the previous video. So that just having everything, all of these interactions, cast into one form--into the Django form in this case--makes it easier, because there's more or less just one thing that you need to learn. And you can still do a lot of tasks, such as database interactions, for example.

Additionally, to all of the stuff that's already included in Django, there's a very rich third party ecosystem. So lots and lots of packages that other people built that you can reuse. And what ties in with that is that there are pluggable apps. The structure of a Django project is that you can re-use different applications. We're going to talk about all of this much more, but just so you understand, you can build an app once and then you can reuse it in different projects or reuse the app that someone else built for you.

And then there's the Django ORM, ORM stands for object-relational mapper. And don't worry about it right now. Just know that this exists and it means that it allows you to interact with the database, any database, through very understandable Python syntax, without needing to go into depth with a specific database language. You can just write Python and interact with the database.

And as I mentioned at the beginning, one of my main reasons, also the way I like using it is that it is built in Python and Python is just all around a great language for many use cases. Maybe you already know Python, then Django is a great way to extend the knowledge that you have in programming in general, and add web development to the list of things you know. Or if you're getting started with web development and you know a bit of Python, just know that if you learn this language, it's going to have a lot of use in a lot of different places. 

## Conclusion

Here's the recap in writing on why Django is a great choice for learning web development:

- **Community**: Django has a large, active, and welcoming community, which helps to find answers more quickly and stay engaged
- **Time- and battle-tested**: Django has been around and in use since 2005. There are many large projects that use the framework successfully and have done so for many years
- **Batteries included**: Django comes with everything you need already installed
- **Third-party packages**: If your project is special and you need something more specific than Django's batteries, there's a huge ecosystem of mature third-party packages to choose from
- **Pluggable Apps**: Django's structure relies on pluggable apps, which means that you can build an app for one project, and reuse it in another one
- **Django ORM**: You don't need to interact with your database using SQL but can instead use Django's in-built Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). This makes it possible to easily switch database backends without having to change your code
- **Python**: And, last but not least, Django is built in Python, your friendly neighborhood programming language that is easy to get started with and scales very well. It also has many applications ranging across data science, scripting, devops, web development into machine learning. It's a useful language, not just for web development
