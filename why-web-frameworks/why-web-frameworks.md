# What Is A Web Framework And Why Do You Want To Use One?

You probably heard the term before, but what does it really mean and why would you want to use a web framework in the first place? The video below will address these question, and you can also find a transcript and a conclusion below:

## Transcript

Welcome to the section about getting started with Django. And before we take a look at the block project that you are going to build in this section, let's just talk in general about why would you want to use a web framework in the first place? The reason for this is that the web, as a structure, as a system, **grew organically**.

It started as a little seedling and kept growing over time until there were lots of new technologists that kept getting stuck on top of each other and arranged to inter-operate.

There's HTML, there's CSS, there's JavaScript there are databases that you all have to interact with. There are back-end languages, Python is one of those, there are database interactions with SQL and it just kept growing and growing. So that the internet became this very, very, very big thing. And it's just really a complex mess.

So it's hard to get a grasp of what's going on and how to handle everything that needs to fit together to create a web app, or anything that you want to publish on the web. There's just so much that goes into that.

And the idea of a web framework is essentially just that it automates repetitive web development tasks:

- It allows you to abstract database interactions. So you maybe don't have to write SQL as a pure language, cutting down one of the languages you need to know for web development
- It handles your L requests and your L mapping for you
- It provides templates and frameworks and allows you to generate HTML sites on the go with a language that is more familiar to you
- And it helps with security, cashing, sessions, et cetera.

So the web frameworks help you with all of these things. And to just sum it up in one quick go:

>web development is a mess and web frameworks is web development, simplified.

Okay. So that's why you would want to use a web framework in general. And in the next video, we're going to talk about why you would want to use **Django** as a web framework. 

## Conclusion

Let's recap that again in concise writing. First and foremost: _The web is a mess_. You'll want to use a web framework because it _simplifies web development_. More specifically, it helps you to:

- **Automate** repetitive web development tasks
- **Abstract** database interactions
- **Handle** URL requests and URL mapping
- **Provide** templating frameworks
- **Help** with security, caching, sessions, etc.

In this post you learned about what web frameworks are and why they are useful for web development. In the next post, you will learn about why _Django_ is a great choice for a Python web framework.
